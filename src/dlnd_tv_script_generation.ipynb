    "**Answer:** \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **learning_rate**: Following the best practice, I have set the learning rate to be 0.001. Again Adam optimizer is being used here which adjust the relative learning rates of parameters. Though i have not tried with tuning the learning rate manually during training.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **hidden_dimension** : I tried with a bit higher dimension of 350 and 3 RNN layer, but found training time increases and as well as loss reduced to only 3.35!!. Since it is being told in the course that hidden dimention is preferred to be within the range of 200-300, I kept it to be 256(as also used in tutorials) and found a good decrease in loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **n_layers**: I tried with 3 RNN layers, but loss was not decreasing faster. Since the best practice is to keep the number of RNN layers between 2-3, I tried and kept it to 2 and found a good result.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **embedding_dim** : I tried with embedding_dim of 300, a hidden_dim of 256, 2 RNN layers, 10 epochs and a learning rate of 0.001 and sequence length of 10, I achieved a loss of 3.31. I found it is best practice to keep the embedding dimension between 100-400. So while tweaking the hyperparameters, i changed the embedding dim to 400 and found a good result.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **batch_size** : I tried with 256 and found the error didn't come down to 3.5 even after training for 8 epochs. But with batch size of 128, it works much better.\n",

    "I have planned to test the behaviour by using 2 FC layer instead of 1 may be and also try with manual use of adaptive learning and check how things varies with this as well."

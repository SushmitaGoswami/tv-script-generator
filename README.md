# Tv-script-generator
TV Script Generator is a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree!

# Project Overview
TV Script Generator generates "fake" Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs.

Model is trained based on the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Sample training script:

jerry: do you know what this is all about? do you know, why were here? to be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. people...did you ever hear people talking about we should go out? this is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. not one person here is home, were all out! there are people trying to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) did you ring?, i cant find him. where did he go? he didnt tell me where he was going. he must have gone out. you wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? you take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...then youre standing around, what do you do? you go we gotta be getting back. once youre out, you wanna get back! you wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go. 

jerry: (pointing at georges shirt) see, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. the second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. its too high! its in no-mans-land. you look like you live with your mother. 

george: are you through? 

jerry: you do of course try on, when you buy? 

george: yes, it was purple, i liked it, i dont actually recall considering the buttons. 

## Sample generated script:
jerry: parade."

elaine: hey! hey, what is that?!

jerry: what?

george: you don't have to do that.

george: i don't want to be here.

jerry: you want to be able to go?

jerry: i don't think i can do this.

jerry: oh, you know i have to tell you, jerry.

helen: yes, i think i was blind.

george: oh, it's the most complicated.

jerry: what?

george: i know, i don't want to get a pee- bone jet. i can't believe that was the network.

kramer: yeah.

jerry: oh, yeah.

george: i was screamin' to the game.

jerry: you know, i don't even know what i can do, but i don't know.

elaine: oh.

jerry: so what is that dot?

jerry: no!

jerry: yes!

george: i know that was a little anxious.

george: what are you doin' here?

george: no further questions.

george: you don't have any cheese?

elaine: oh, yeah.

george: i think it's a big deal.

elaine: what happened with that?

george: i think i should be a little less egg flights.

kramer: well, i'm entitled to tufts.

jerry: you don't have any cheese?

jerry: i was in the network law, but it's not complicated for the lipo.

elaine: well, what happened to the defendants?

jerry: i think i should be a big problem.

george: i don't know if i can do it. i am not going to have to go in the bathroom. i was watchin' longer.

george: oh, i know.

george: you know, i was thinking of that.

jerry: so, what happened with?

elaine: i can't.

jerry: you know what the
